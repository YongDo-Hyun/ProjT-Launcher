# 🚀 Getting Started

## ⚠️ Compliance Warning

**This project requires a consistent development environment.** Deviating from the specified tool versions or configurations may result in build failures.

## Prerequisites

Before you write any code, you need to set up your workspace. If you are new to open source, follow these steps carefully.

### 1. Understand the Rules

- **Code of Conduct**: We want a safe community. Read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Security**: Found a hack? Don't post it publicly! Read [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

### 2. Get the Code (Fork & Clone)

You cannot edit the main project directly. You need your own copy.

1. **Fork**: Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the GitHub page. This creates a copy of `ProjT-Launcher` in your own account (e.g., `YourName/ProjT-Launcher`).
2. **Clone**: Download your fork to your computer. Open your terminal (PowerShell or Terminal) and run:

   ```bash
   # Replace 'YourName' with your GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/YourName/ProjT-Launcher.git
   cd ProjT-Launcher
   ```

3. **Add Upstream**: Link your local copy to the original project so you can get updates.

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/YongDo-Hyun/ProjT-Launcher.git
   ```

## 🛠 Development Environment

## Required Tools (And Why We Need Them)

We use specific tools to build the launcher. You **must** install the exact versions listed.

| Tool | Version | What is it? | Why strict? |
| ------ | --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **CMake** | 3.22+ | The "Builder". It creates the instructions for how to compile the code. | Old versions miss features we use. |
| **Qt** | 6.x (Latest) | The "Framework". It provides the windows, buttons, and graphics. | **CRITICAL**. We use Qt 6 features. |
| **Compiler** | C++20 | The "Translator". Converts C++ code into an executable (.exe). | We use modern C++20 features (concepts, ranges). |
| **Ninja** | 1.10+ | The "Worker". It executes the build instructions from CMake very fast. | It's much faster than Make or MSBuild. |
| **Git** | 2.30+ | The "Time Machine". Tracks changes and versions. | Required for version control. |
| **Java JDK** | 8, 17, 21 | The "Engine". Required to actually run Minecraft. | Minecraft requires specific Java versions. |

## 🖥️ OS-Specific Setup

### Windows

We recommend using **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code** with the MSVC compiler.

- Install Visual Studio 2022 Community:
  - Workload: "Desktop development with C++"
- Install Qt 6:
  - Use the Qt Online Installer.
  - Select Custom installation.
  - Select `Qt 6.10.1` -> `MSVC 2022 64-bit`.
  - Select `All additional libraries`.
  - Select `Qt Shader Tools`.
- Install Vcpkg (Dependency Manager):
  - Please run vcpkg install in the project directory.

### Linux

- Install Nix: Follow the instructions at <https://nixos.org/download.html>
- Enter the development environment:

```bash
nix develop .#default
```

This will provide all necessary dependencies including Qt 6, CMake, Ninja, and compilers.

### macOS

- Install Nix: Follow the instructions at <https://nixos.org/download.html>
- Enter the development environment:

```bash
nix develop .#default
```

This will provide all necessary dependencies including Qt 6, CMake, Ninja, and compilers.

## ⚙️ IDE Configuration

### Visual Studio Code (Highly Recommended)

- Extensions:
  - **C/C++** (Microsoft)
  - **CMake Tools** (Microsoft)
  - **clangd** (LLVM) - *Disable C/C++ IntelliSense if using this.*
  - **Qt All Extensions Pack** (Optional, for QML syntax highlighting)

- Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
    "cmake.configureOnOpen": true,
    "cmake.generator": "Ninja",
    "files.associations": {
        "*.h": "cpp",
        "*.cpp": "cpp",
        "*.qml": "qml"
    }
}
```

- Launch Configuration (`.vscode/launch.json`):
  Use this to debug the application directly from VS Code.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug Launcher",
            "type": "cppvsdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
            "args": [],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "QT_LOGGING_RULES",
                    "value": "*.debug=true"
                }
            ],
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 🏗️ Building the Project

### Using VS Code (Easiest)

- Open the folder in VS Code.
- Select your Kit (e.g., `Visual Studio Community 2022 Release - amd64`).
- Click **Build** in the status bar (or press `F7`).
- Click **Run** (play button) to start the launcher.

### Using Command Line

```bash
# 1. Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# 2. Configure (Replace path to Qt if not in PATH)
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.x/msvc2019_64" -GNinja ..

# 3. Build
ninja

# 4. Run
./Launcher.exe
```

- Debug Configuration (`.vscode/launch.json`):
  Create this file to enable F5 debugging.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug Launcher",
            "type": "cppvsdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
            "args": [],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "PATH",
                    "value": "${env:PATH};C:/Qt/6.10.1/msvc2019_64/bin"
                }
            ],
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Qt Creator

- Open Project: Open `CMakeLists.txt` as a project.
- Kit Selection: Select the Kit matching your Qt 6.10.1 installation.
- Code Style: Go to `Tools > Options > C++ > Code Style` and import `.clang-format`.

## 🏗️ Build Instructions (Step-by-Step)

Building means converting the source code (text files) into an executable program (like `.exe`)

### Step 1: Configure

**What it does:** Checks your system for the required tools (Qt, Compiler) and creates a "build plan".
**Command:**

```bash
# First, see what presets are available for your OS
cmake --list-presets

# For Windows (Visual Studio):
cmake --preset windows_msvc

# For Linux:
cmake --preset linux
```

*If this fails, CMake can't find your tools. Check the Troubleshooting section.*

### Step 2: Build

**What it does:** Compiles the code. This takes time.
**Command:**

```bash
# Build in Debug mode (Best for coding, has extra checks)
cmake --build --preset windows_msvc --config Debug

# Build in Release mode (Best for playing, runs fast)
cmake --build --preset windows_msvc --config Release
```

### Step 3: Run

**What it does:** Starts the launcher!
**Command:**

```bash
# The executable will be in the build folder
./build/windows_msvc/Debug/ProjT-Launcher.exe
```

### Step 4: Test

**What it does:** Runs automated checks to make sure you didn't break anything.
**Command:**

```bash
ctest --preset windows_msvc --build-config Debug --output-on-failure
```

## Supported Presets

| Preset | Description | OS |
| ------ | ----------- | -- |
| `windows_msvc` | MSVC Compiler (Standard) | Windows |
| `windows_mingw` | MinGW GCC (Alternative) | Windows |
| `linux` | GCC/Clang | Linux |
| `macos` | Clang (Apple) | macOS |
| `ci-windows` | CI Configuration | Windows |

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Qt Config file not found"

- **Cause**: CMake cannot find your Qt installation.
- **Fix**: Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your Qt bin folder.

```bash
cmake --preset windows_msvc -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.10.1/msvc2019_64"
```

### "Ninja not found"

- **Cause**: Ninja is not in your PATH.
- **Fix**: Install Ninja and add it to PATH, or use `Visual Studio` generator (slower).

### "C++20 not supported"

- **Cause**: Your compiler is too old.
- **Fix**: Update VS 2022, GCC to 11+, or Clang to 14+.
